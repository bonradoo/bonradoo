# About me ü§ô

Hello there! I'm Konrad, a software developer and second-year cybersecurity student hailing from Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

## Projects üéõÔ∏è

At present, I am engaged in the development of a personal project named [Financial Tracker](https://github.com/bonradoo/financial-tracker), which is a Python-based tool for keeping a tab on personal finances and investments. Initially, the project began as a terminal application, then transitioned to a custom tkinter interface, and now I'm in the process of reworking it using PyQT5.

In addition to my current project, I am also studying cybersecurity at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, where I am learning about various topics including network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking. In my previous semester, I delved into the intricacies of the Bash scripting language as a part of one of my courses. For the final project, I was tasked with developing a simulation for process scheduling and page replacement algorithms, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/bonradoo/operating-systems).
