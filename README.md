# About me 👨‍💻
Hello, world! I'm **Konrad** from Wrocław, Poland. Currently, I am a software developer and a second-year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Technology.

## My Projects 💻
I have been involved in several projects that allowed me to explore different aspects of software development and cybersecurity. Here's a snapshot of my work:

### Carrige weight app ```private``` 🚛
A Flask-based web application leveraging Google Cloud Datastore as the database. This application enables users to manage and track carriage data with features such as user authentication and QR code scanning for efficient data entry. Tech stack used: Flask, Google Cloud Datastore, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jsQR library.

### [Financial Tracker](https://github.com/bonradoo/financial-tracker) 💵
A Python application built with the PySide2 library that provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal expenses and income. It features a graphical representation of expenses through pie charts, allowing users to visualize their spending habits.

### [Process Scheduling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konradbik/) ⏲️
A Python-based simulation of process scheduling algorithms including FCFS, FIFO, LRU, and SJF. The algorithms calculate completion time, turn around time, and wait time for processes or page faults in a paging system. Results are saved in CSV files and displayed on the console.
