# About me 👨‍💻
Hello, world! I'm **Konrad** from Wrocław, Poland. Currently, I am a software developer and a third-year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Technology.

## My Projects 💻
I have been involved in several projects that allowed me to explore different aspects of software development and cybersecurity. Here's a snapshot of my work:

### Carrige weight app ```private``` 🚛
A Flask-based web app developed for a Polish brown coal mine to optimize loading capabilities. I handled the entire design, infrastructure, development, and implementation. The app uses MongoDB and MsSQL to manage RFID reads, weight data, and user info, leading to a 12% improvement in loading efficiency. Tech stack: Flask, MongoDB, MsSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### [Financial Tracker](https://github.com/bonradoo/financial-tracker) 💵
A Python application built with the PySide2 library that provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal expenses and income. It features a graphical representation of expenses through pie charts, allowing users to visualize their spending habits.

### [StreamHub](https://github.com/bonradoo/projekt-bazy-danych) 🎬
The project is web application utilizing Flask, MongoDB, HTML, and Tailwind CSS, specifically tailored for movie database management. It offers a user-friendly platform to post movie reviews, create personalized watchlists, and share these lists with friends or the public. Furthermore, it incorporates the OMDB API, enabling users to seamlessly discover and add new films, thus ensuring the database remains up-to-date with the latest movie releases.
