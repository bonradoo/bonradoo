# About Me 👨‍💻

Hello, world! I'm **Konrad** from Wrocław, Poland. I'm a software developer and a fourth-year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, nearing graduation. My bachelor's thesis focuses on **"Threat analysis and mitigation in a web application for a brown coal mining company,"** reflecting my passion for securing real-world applications.

## My Projects 💻

I've been involved in several projects that have allowed me to explore different facets of software development and cybersecurity. Here's a snapshot of my work:

### Cargo-Pro.pl *(Private)* 🚛

A Flask-based web application developed for **Kopalnia Węgla Brunatnego Sieniawa**, a Polish brown coal mine, to optimize carriage loading capabilities. As a one-person team, I handled the entire design, infrastructure, development, and implementation. The app uses MongoDB and MsSQL to manage RFID reads, weight data, and user information, leading to a **12% improvement in loading efficiency**. This project taught me the value of applying technology to optimize industrial processes.

- **Tech Stack:** Flask, MongoDB, MsSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Cloud Platform

### Deepfake Detector 🤖

As the team lead, I formulated comprehensive project guidelines, established the core structure, and authored a significant portion of the codebase. The project utilizes machine learning detection models to identify deepfake content, enhancing capabilities in cybersecurity.

- **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, Google Cloud Platform, MongoDB, HuggingFace, AI, GitHub

### [Financial Tracker](https://github.com/bonradoo/financial-tracker) 💵

A Python application built with the PySide2 library that provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal expenses and income. It features graphical representations of expenses through pie charts, allowing users to visualize their spending habits.

### StreamHub🎬

A web application utilizing Flask, MongoDB, HTML, and Tailwind CSS, tailored for movie database management. It offers a platform to post movie reviews, create personalized watchlists, and share these lists with friends or the public. It incorporates the OMDB API, enabling users to discover and add new films.
