# About me

Hello there! My name is Konrad and I am a second-year cybersecurity student and software developer based in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

## Projects

Currently, I am working on a personal project called [Financial Tracker](https://github.com/bonradoo/financial-tracker), which is a Python application for tracking and managing personal finances and investments.

I am also in the process of learning Bash scripting for one of my classes. You can find it [here](https://github.com/bonradoo/operating-systems).

In addition to my current project, I am also studying cybersecurity at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, where I am learning about various topics including network security, cryptography, and ethical hacking.
